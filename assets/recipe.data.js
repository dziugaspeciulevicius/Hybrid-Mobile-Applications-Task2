    ingredients: {
      "For the base": [
        "300g strong bread flour",
        "1 tps instant yeast",
        "1 tps salt",
        "1 tbsp olive oil",
      ],
      "For the tomato sauce": [
        "100ml passata",
        "Handful fresh basil or 1 tps dried",
        "1 garlic clove, crushed",
      ],
      "For the topping": [
        "125g ball mozzarella, sliced",
        "handful grated or shaved parmesan",
        "handful or cherry tomatoes, halved",
      ],
      "To finish": "Handfull of basil leaves (optional)",
    },
    instructions: {
      "Step 1":
        "Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.",
      "Step 2":
        "Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.",
      "Step 3":
        "Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.",
      "Step 4":
        "Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.",

      "Bake an impressive dinner party dessert with minimum fuss – these chocolate puddings, also known as chocolate fondant or lava cake, have a lovely gooey centre",
    ingredients: [
      "100g butter, plus extra to grease",
      "100g dark chocolate, chopped",
      "150g light brown soft sugar",
      "½ tsp vanilla extract",
      "50g plain flour",
      "single cream, to serve",
    ],
    instructions: {
      "Step 1":
        "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Butter 6 dariole moulds or basins well and place on a baking tray.",
      "Step 2":
        "Put 100g butter and 100g chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set over a pan of hot water (or alternatively put in the microwave and melt in 30 second bursts on a low setting) and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly for 15 mins.",
      "Step 3":
        "Using an electric hand whisk, mix in 150g light brown soft sugar, then 3 large eggs, one at a time, followed by ½ tsp vanilla extract and finally 50g plain flour. Divide the mixture among the darioles or basins.",
      "Step 4":
        "You can now either put the mixture in the fridge, or freezer until you're ready to bake them. Can be cooked straight from frozen for 16 mins, or bake now for 10-12 mins until the tops are firm to the touch but the middles still feel squidgy.",
      "Step 5":
        "Carefully run a knife around the edge of each pudding, then turn out onto serving plates and serve with single cream.",
